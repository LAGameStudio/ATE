# Getting Started Developing in ATE

When I have more time I will try to provide some tutorial and source code tours.  For now, just load up the solution in 2022 and get to buildin'

Please note ATE is 32-bit so you want to build Win32 versions only.

You should build for debug using "Debug Quiet Divide By Zero Warning" as default. 

You should make sure to then test your changes in "Release with Debug Symbols", "Release with Full Debug", then "Release" mode.

To be continued...
